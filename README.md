# Low-Level-Design
This repository is dedicated to my practice and exploration of low-level design principles and patterns. It contains a collection of projects, exercises, and notes to improve my understanding and skills in designing robust, efficient, and maintainable software systems from the ground up. Each project focuses on different aspects of low-level design, including object-oriented design, design patterns, UML diagrams, SOLID principles, data structures, algorithms, and system architecture.

## Contents
  * Projects: Real-world scenarios and problem statements with detailed design solutions.
  * Design Patterns: Implementations and explanations of common design patterns.
  * UML Diagrams: Visual representations of system designs.
  * Data Structures & Algorithms: Custom implementations and performance analyses.
  * Notes & Best Practices: Key takeaways and guidelines for effective low-level design.
    
## Goals
  * To practice and refine low-level design skills.
  * To understand and apply SOLID principles and design patterns effectively.
  * To create efficient and maintainable code.
  * To document and share insights and best practices.
